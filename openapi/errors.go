// API error rules for the Databricks REST API based on HTTP status codes.
//
// The API responds with an error by setting the HTTP status code to 400 or
// higher and returning a JSON object with an error code and message. Error
// responses are hierarchical in nature, with the HTTP status code providing
// the highest level of categorization. The error_code field in the response
// provides a more granular categorization of the error.
//
// The SDK attempts to map these error responses to error objects based on this
// mapping by applying the following logic:
//
//  1. If the error matches an override defined in ErrorOverrides, return the
//     override.
//  2. If the error_code field of the response matches a key in
//     ErrorCodeMapping, return that error.
//  3. If the HTTP status code matches a rule in ErrorStatusCodeMapping, return
//     that error.
