	// Get the status of libraries on a cluster. A status will be available for
	// all libraries installed on this cluster via the API or the libraries UI
	// as well as libraries set to be installed on all clusters via the
	// libraries UI. The order of returned libraries will be as follows.
	//
	// 1. Libraries set to be installed on this cluster will be returned first.
	// Within this group, the final order will be order in which the libraries
	// were added to the cluster.
	//
	// 2. Libraries set to be installed on all clusters are returned next.

	//
	// 3. Libraries that were previously requested on this cluster or on all
	// clusters, but now marked for removal. Within this group there is no order
	// guarantee.
