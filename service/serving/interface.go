// The Serving Endpoints API allows you to create, update, and delete model
// serving endpoints.
//
// You can use a serving endpoint to serve models from the Databricks Model
// Registry. Endpoints expose the underlying models as scalable REST API
// endpoints using serverless compute. This means the endpoints and associated
// compute resources are fully managed by Databricks and will not appear in your
// cloud account. A serving endpoint can consist of one or more MLflow models
// from the Databricks Model Registry, called served models. A serving endpoint
// can have at most ten served models. You can configure traffic settings to
// define how requests should be routed to your served models behind an
// endpoint. Additionally, you can configure the scale of resources that should
// be applied to each served model.
