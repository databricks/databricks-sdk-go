// The Jobs API allows you to create, edit, and delete jobs.
//
// You can use a Databricks job to run a data processing or data analysis task
// in a Databricks cluster with scalable resources. Your job can consist of a
// single task or can be a large, multi-task workflow with complex dependencies.
// Databricks manages the task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring,
// and error reporting for all of your jobs. You can run your jobs immediately
// or periodically through an easy-to-use scheduling system. You can implement
// job tasks using notebooks, JARS, Delta Live Tables pipelines, or Python,
// Scala, Spark submit, and Java applications.
//
// You should never hard code secrets or store them in plain text. Use the
// [Secrets CLI] to manage secrets in the [Databricks CLI]. Use the [Secrets
// utility] to reference secrets in notebooks and jobs.
//
// Deprecated: Do not use this interface, it will be removed in a future version of the SDK.
