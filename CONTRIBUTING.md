# Contributing Guide

## This repository is a mirror

This repository is a read-only mirror. The SDK's source of truth lives in
Databricks' internal repository, and changes are published here as part of each
release.

- **Issues:** report bugs and feature requests in
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/issues).
- **External contributors:** propose improvements in a pull request here.
  Maintainers review these PRs publicly and re-apply approved changes in the
  internal repository for a subsequent release, rather than merging them here.
- **Databricks employees:** make SDK changes in the internal repository.

Only maintainer-approved synchronization PRs carrying the `sync` label are
merged into this mirror.
