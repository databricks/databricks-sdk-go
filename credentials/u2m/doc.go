/*
Package u2m supports the user-to-machine (U2M) OAuth flow for authenticating with Databricks.

Databricks uses the authorization code flow from OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users. This flow
consists of four steps:
 1. Retrieve an authorization code for a user by opening a browser and directing them to the
    Databricks authorization URL.
 2. Exchange the authorization code for an access token.
 3. Use the access token to authenticate with Databricks.
 4. When the access token expires, use the refresh token to get a new access token.

The token and authorization endpoints for Databricks vary depending on whether the host is
an account- or workspace-level host. Account-level endpoints are fixed based on the account
ID and host, while workspace-level endpoints are discovered using the OIDC discovery endpoint
at /oidc/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server.

To trigger the authorization flow, construct a PersistentAuth object and call the
Challenge() method:

	auth, err := oauth.NewPersistentAuth(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to create persistent auth: %v", err)
	}
	token, err := auth.Challenge(ctx, oauth.BasicAccountOAuthArgument{
		AccountHost: "https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com",
		AccountID: "xyz",
	})

Because the U2M flow requires user interaction, the resulting access token and refresh token
can be stored in a persistent cache to avoid prompting the user for credentials on every
authentication attempt. By default, the cache is stored in ~/.databricks/token-cache.json.
Retrieve the cached token by calling the Load() method:

	token, err := auth.Load(ctx, oauth.BasicAccountOAuthArgument{
		AccountHost: "https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com",
		AccountID: "xyz",
	})

See the cache package for more information on customizing the cache.
