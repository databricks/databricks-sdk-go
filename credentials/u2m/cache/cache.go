/*
Package cache provides an interface for storing and looking up OAuth tokens.

The cache should be primarily used for user-to-machine (U2M) OAuth flows. In U2M
OAuth flows, the application needs to store the token for later use, such as in
a separate process, and the cache provides a way to do so without requiring the
user to follow the OAuth flow again.

In machine-to-machine (M2M) OAuth flows, the application is configured with a
secret and can fetch a new token on demand without user interaction, so the
token cache is not necessary.
