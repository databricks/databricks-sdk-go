The Databricks SDK for Go includes functionality to accelerate development with [Go](https://go.dev) for the Databricks Lakehouse. It covers all public [Databricks REST API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/index.html) operations. The SDK's internal HTTP client is robust and handles failures on different levels by performing intelligent retries.

## Getting started

1. On your local development machine with Go already [installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) and a Go code [project](https://go.dev/doc/code) active, create a `go.mod` file to track your Go code's dependencies by running the `go mod init` command, for example:

    ```bash
    go mod init sample
    ```
   
2. Take a dependency on the Databricks SDK for Go package by running the `go mod edit -require` command:

    ```bash
    go mod edit -require github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go@latest
    ```
   
   Your `go.mod` file should now look like this:
   
    ```go
    module sample

    go 1.18

    require github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go v0.9.0

    // Indirect dependencies will go here.
    ```

3. Within your project, create a Go code file that imports the Databricks SDK for Go. The following example, in a file named `main.go` with the following contents, simply lists all the clusters in your Databricks workspace:

    ```go
    package main

    import (
      "context"

      "github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go"
      "github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/service/compute"
    )

    func main() {
      w := databricks.Must(databricks.NewWorkspaceClient())
      all, err := w.Clusters.ListAll(context.Background(), compute.ListClustersRequest{})
      if err != nil {
        panic(err)
      }
      for _, c := range all {
        println(c.ClusterName)
      }
    }
    ```

4. Add any misssing module dependencies by running the `go mod tidy` command:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
   
   **Note**: If you get the error `go: warning: "all" matched no packages`, you forgot to add the preceding Go code file that imports the Databricks SDK for Go. 
   
5. Grab copies of all packages needed to support builds and tests of packages in your `main` module, by running the `go mod vendor` command:

    ```bash
    go mod vendor
    ```

6. Set up Databricks authentication on your local development machine by running [`databricks configure`](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html#set-up-authentication) command, if you have not done so already. For details, see the next section, [Authentication](#authentication).

7. Run your Go code file, assuming a file named `main.go`, by running the `go run` command:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
   
    Assuming the preceding example code is run, the output is: 
  
    ```bash
    [TRACE] Loading config via environment
    [TRACE] Loading config via config-file
    ...
    [TRACE] Attempting to configure auth: pat
    [TRACE] Attempting to configure auth: basic
    [TRACE] Attempting to configure auth: azure-client-secret
    ...
    ```

## Authentication

If you use Databricks [configuration profiles](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#configuration-profiles) or Databricks-specific [environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#environment-variables) for [Databricks authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html), the only code required to start working with a Databricks workspace is the following code snippet, which instructs the Databricks SDK for Go to use its [default authentication flow](#default-authentication-flow):

```go
w := databricks.Must(databricks.NewWorkspaceClient())
w./*press TAB for autocompletion*/
```

The conventional name for the variable that holds the workspace-level client of the Databricks SDK for Go is `w`, which is shorthand for `workspace`.

### In this section

- [Default authentication flow](#default-authentication-flow)
- [Databricks native authentication](#databricks-native-authentication)
- [Azure native authentication](#azure-native-authentication)
- [Google Cloud Platform native authentication](#google-cloud-platform-native-authentication)
- [Overriding .databrickscfg](#overriding-databrickscfg)
- [Additional authentication configuration options](#additional-authentication-configuration-options)
- [Custom credentials provider](#custom-credentials-provider)

### Default authentication flow

If you run the [Databricks Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databrickslabs/databricks/latest), the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html), or applications that target the Databricks SDKs for other langauges, most likely they will all interoperate nicely together. By default, the Databricks SDK for Go tries the following [authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html) methods, in the following order, until it succeeds:

1. [Databricks native authentication](#databricks-native-authentication)
2. [Azure native authentication](#azure-native-authentication)
3. [Google Cloud Platform native authentication](#google-cloud-platform-native-authentication)
4. If the SDK is unsuccessful at this point, it returns an authentication error and stops running.

You can instruct the Databricks SDK for Go to use a specific authentication method by setting the `AuthType` field in `*databricks.Config` as described in the following sections.

For each authentication method, the SDK searches for compatible authentication credentials in the following locations, in the following order. Once the SDK finds a compatible set of credentials that it can use, it stops searching:

1. Credentials that hard-coded into `*databricks.Config`.

   **Caution**: Databricks does not recommend hard-coding credentials into `*databricks.Config`, as they can be exposed in plain text in version control systems. Use environment variables or configuration profiles instead.

2. Credentials in Databricks-specific [environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#environment-variables).
3. For Databricks native authentication, credentials in the `.databrickscfg` file's `DEFAULT` [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#configuration-profiles) from its default file location (`~` for Linux or macOS, and `%USERPROFILE%` for Windows).
4. For Azure or Google Cloud Platform native authentication, the SDK searches for credentials through the Azure CLI or Google Cloud CLI as needed.

Depending on the Databricks authentication method, the SDK uses the following information. Presented are the `*databricks.Config` arguments, their descriptions, any corresponding environment variables, and any corresponding `.databrickscfg` file fields, respectively.

### Databricks native authentication

By default, the Databricks SDK for Go initially tries Databricks token authentication (`AuthType: "pat"` in `*databricks.Config`). If the SDK is unsuccessful, it then tries Databricks basic (username/password) authentication (`AuthType: "basic"` in `*databricks.Config`).

- For Databricks token authentication, you must provide `Host` and `Token`; or their environment variable or `.databrickscfg` file field equivalents.
- For Databricks basic authentication, you must provide `Host`, `Username`, and `Password` _(for AWS workspace-level operations)_; or `Host`, `AccountID`, `Username`, and `Password` _(for AWS, Azure, or GCP account-level operations)_; or their environment variable or `.databrickscfg` file field equivalents.

| `*databricks.Config` argument | Description | Environment variable / `.databrickscfg` file field |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Host` | _(String)_ The Databricks host URL for either the Databricks workspace endpoint or the Databricks accounts endpoint. | `DATABRICKS_HOST` /  `host` |     
| `AccountID` | _(String)_ The Databricks account ID for the Databricks accounts endpoint. Only has effect when `Host` is either `https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/` _(AWS)_, `https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/` _(Azure)_, or `https://accounts.gcp.databricks.com/` _(GCP)_. | `DATABRICKS_ACCOUNT_ID` / `account_id` |
| `Token` | _(String)_ The Databricks personal access token (PAT) _(AWS, Azure, and GCP)_ or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) token _(Azure)_. | `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` / `token` |
| `Username` | _(String)_ The Databricks username part of basic authentication. Only possible when `Host` is `*.cloud.databricks.com` _(AWS)_. | `DATABRICKS_USERNAME` / `username` |
| `Password` | _(String)_ The Databricks password part of basic authentication. Only possible when `Host` is `*.cloud.databricks.com` _(AWS)_. | `DATABRICKS_PASSWORD` / `password` |

For example, to use Databricks token authentication:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go"
	"github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/config"
)

func main() {
	// Perform Databricks token authentication for a Databricks workspace.
	w, err := databricks.NewWorkspaceClient(&databricks.Config{
		Host:        askFor("Host:"),                  // workspace url
		Token:       askFor("Personal Access Token:"), // PAT
		Credentials: config.PatCredentials{},          // enforce PAT auth
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	me, err := w.CurrentUser.Me(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s!\n", me.DisplayName)
}

func askFor(prompt string) string {
	var s string
	r := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	for {
		fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, prompt+" ")
		s, _ = r.ReadString('\n')
		s = strings.TrimSpace(s)
		if s != "" {
			break
		}
	}
	return s
}
```

### Azure native authentication

By default, the Databricks SDK for Go first tries Azure client secret authentication (`AuthType: "azure-client-secret"` in `*databricks.Config`). If the SDK is unsuccessful, it then tries Azure CLI authentication (`AuthType: "azure-cli"` in `*databricks.Config`). See [Manage service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals).

The Databricks SDK for Go picks up an Azure CLI token, if you've previously authenticated as an Azure user by running `az login` on your machine. See [Get Azure AD tokens for users by using the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/aad/user-aad-token). 

To authenticate as an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service principal, you must provide one of the following. See also [Add a service principal to your Azure Databricks account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals#add-sp-account):

- `AzureResourceID`, `AzureClientSecret`, `AzureClientID`, and `AzureTenantID`; or their environment variable or `.databrickscfg` file field equivalents.
- `AzureResourceID` and `AzureUseMSI`; or their environment variable or `.databrickscfg` file field equivalents.

| `*databricks.Config` argument | Description | Environment variable / `.databrickscfg` file field |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `AzureResourceID` | _(String)_ The Azure Resource Manager ID for the Azure Databricks workspace, which is exchanged for a Databricks host URL. |  `DATABRICKS_AZURE_RESOURCE_ID` / `azure_workspace_resource_id` |
| `AzureUseMSI` | _(Boolean)_ `true` to use Azure Managed Service Identity passwordless authentication flow for service principals. Requires `AzureResourceID` to be set. | `ARM_USE_MSI` / `azure_use_msi` |
| `AzureClientSecret` | _(String)_ The Azure AD service principal's client secret. | `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` / `azure_client_secret` |
| `AzureClientID` | _(String)_ The Azure AD service principal's application ID. | `ARM_CLIENT_ID` / `azure_client_id` |
| `AzureTenantID` | _(String)_ The Azure AD service principal's tenant ID. | `ARM_TENANT_ID` / `azure_tenant_id` |
| `AzureEnvironment`| _(String)_ The Azure environment type (such as Public, UsGov, China, and Germany) for a specific set of API endpoints. Defaults to `PUBLIC`. | `ARM_ENVIRONMENT` / `azure_environment` |

For example, to use Azure client secret authentication:

```go
w, err := databricks.NewWorkspaceClient(&databricks.Config{
  Host:              askFor("Host:"),
  AzureResourceID:   askFor("Azure Resource ID:"),
  AzureTenantID:     askFor("AAD Tenant ID:"),
  AzureClientID:     askFor("AAD Client ID:"),
  AzureClientSecret: askFor("AAD Client Secret:"),
  Credentials:       config.AzureClientSecretCredentials{},
})
```

### Google Cloud Platform native authentication

By default, the Databricks SDK for Go first tries GCP credentials authentication (`AuthType: "google-credentials"` in `*databricks.Config`). If the SDK is unsuccessful, it then tries Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ID authentication (`AuthType: "google-id"` in `*databricks.Config`).

The Databricks SDK for Go picks up an OAuth token in the scope of the Google Default Application Credentials (DAC) flow. This means that if you have run `gcloud auth application-default login` on your development machine, or launch the application on the compute, that is allowed to impersonate the Google Cloud service account specified in `GoogleServiceAccount`. Authentication should then work out of the box. See [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

To authenticate as a Google Cloud service account, you must provide one of the following:

- `Host` and `GoogleCredentials`; or their environment variable or `.databrickscfg` file field equivalents.
- `Host` and `GoogleServiceAccount`; or their environment variable or `.databrickscfg` file field equivalents.

| `*databricks.Config` argument | Description | Environment variable / `.databrickscfg` file field |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `GoogleCredentials`| _(String)_ GCP Service Account Credentials JSON or the location of these credentials on the local filesystem. | `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` / `google_credentials` |
| `GoogleServiceAccount`| _(String)_ The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account e-mail used for impersonation in the Default Application Credentials Flow that does not require a password. | `DATABRICKS_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` / `google_service_account` |

For example, to use Google ID authentication:

```go
w, err := databricks.NewWorkspaceClient(&databricks.Config{
  Host:                 askFor("Host:"),
  GoogleServiceAccount: askFor("Google Service Account:"),
  Credentials:          config.GoogleDefaultCredentials{},
})
```

### Overriding `.databrickscfg` 

For [Databricks native authentication](#databricks-native-authentication), you can override the default behavior in `*databricks.Config` for using `.databrickscfg` as follows:

| `*databricks.Config` argument | Description | Environment variable |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `Profile` | _(String)_ A connection profile specified within `.databrickscfg` to use instead of `DEFAULT`. | `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE` |
| `ConfigFile` | _(String)_ A non-default location of the Databricks CLI credentials file. | `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_FILE` |

For example, to use a profile named `MYPROFILE` instead of `DEFAULT`:

```go
w := databricks.Must(databricks.NewWorkspaceClient(&databricks.Config{
  Profile:  "MYPROFILE",
}))
// Now call the Databricks workspace APIs as desired...
```

### Additional authentication configuration options

For all authentication methods, you can override the default behavior in `*databricks.Config` as follows:

| `*databricks.Config` argument | Description | Environment variable |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `AuthType` | _(String)_ When multiple auth attributes are available in the environment, use the auth type specified by this argument. This argument also holds the currently selected auth. | _(None)_ |
| `HTTPTimeoutSeconds` | _(Integer)_ Number of seconds for HTTP timeout. Default is _60_. | _(None)_ |
| `RetryTimeoutSeconds`| _(Integer)_ Number of seconds to keep retrying HTTP requests. Default is _300 (5 minutes)_. | _(None)_ |
| `DebugTruncateBytes` | _(Integer)_ Truncate JSON fields in debug logs above this limit. Default is 96. | `DATABRICKS_DEBUG_TRUNCATE_BYTES` |
| `DebugHeaders` | _(Boolean)_ `true` to debug HTTP headers of requests made by the application. Default is `false`, as headers contain sensitive data, such as access tokens. | `DATABRICKS_DEBUG_HEADERS` |
| `RateLimit` | _(Integer)_ Maximum number of requests per second made to Databricks REST API. | `DATABRICKS_RATE_LIMIT` |

For example, to turn on debug HTTP headers:

```go
w := databricks.Must(databricks.NewWorkspaceClient(&databricks.Config{
  DebugHeaders: true,
}))  
// Now call the Databricks workspace APIs as desired...
```

### Custom credentials provider

In some cases, you may want to have deeper control over authentication to Databricks. This can be achieved by creating your own credentials provider that returns an HTTP request visitor:

```go
type CustomCredentials struct {}

func (c *CustomCredentials) Name() string {
	return "custom"
}

func (c *CustomCredentials) Configure(ctx context.Context, cfg *config.Config) (func(*http.Request) error, error) {
	return func(r *http.Request) error {
		token := "..."
		r.Header.Set("Authorization", fmt.Sprintf("Bearer %s", token))
		return nil
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	w := databricks.Must(databricks.NewWorkspaceClient(&databricks.Config{
		Credentials: &CustomCredentials{},
	}))
    // ..
}
```

## Code examples

To find code examples that demonstrate how to call the Databricks SDK for Go, see the top-level [examples](/examples) folder within this repository

## Long-running operations

More than 20 methods across different Databricks APIs are long-running operations for managing things like clusters, command execution, jobs, libraries, Delta Live Tables pipelines, and Databricks SQL warehouses. For example, in the Clusters API, once you create a cluster, you receive a cluster ID, and the cluster is in the `PENDING` state while Databricks takes care of provisioning virtual machines from the cloud provider in the background. But the cluster is only usable in the `RUNNING` state. Another example is the API for running a job or repairing the run: right after the run starts, the run is in the `PENDING` state, though the job is considered to be finished only when it is in the `TERMINATED` or `SKIPPED` states. And of course you. would want to know the error message when the long-running operation times out or why things fail. And sometimes you want to configure a custom timeout other than the default of 20 minutes. 

To hide all of the integration-specific complexity from the end user, Databricks SDK for Go provides a high-level API for _triggering_ the long-running operations and _waiting_ for the releated entities to reach the right state or return back the error message about the problem in case of failure. All long-running operations have the `XxxAndWait` name pattern, where `Xxx` is the operation name. All these generated methods return information about the relevant entity once the operation is finished. It is possible to configure a custom timeout to `XxxAndWait` by providing a functional option argument constructed by `retries.Timeout[Zzz](time.Duration)` function, where `Zzz` is the result type of `XxxAndWait`.

In the following example, `CreateAndWait` returns `ClusterInfo` only once the cluster is in the `RUNNING` state, otherwise it will timeout in 10 minutes:

```go
clusterInfo, err = w.Clusters.CreateAndWait(ctx, clusters.CreateCluster{
    ClusterName:            "Created cluster",
    SparkVersion:           latestLTS,
    NodeTypeId:             smallestWithDisk,
    AutoterminationMinutes: 10,
    NumWorkers:             1,
}, retries.Timeout[clusters.ClusterInfo](10*time.Minute))
```

- [Cluster library management](#cluster-library-management)
- [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage)

### Command execution on clusters

You can run Python, Scala, R, or SQL code on running interactive Databricks clusters and get the results back. All supplied code gets leading whitespace removed, so that you could easily embed Python code into Go applications. This high-level wrapper comes from the Databricks Terraform provider, where it was tested for over 2 years for use cases such as [DBFS mounts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs/resources/mount) and [SQL permissions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs/resources/sql_permissions). This interface hides the intricate complexity of all internal APIs involved to simplify the unit-testing experience for command execution. Databricks does not recommending that you use lower-level interfaces for command execution. The execution timeout is 20 minutes and cannot be overriden for the sake of interface simplicity, meaning that you should only use this API if you have some relatively complex executions to perform. Please use jobs in case your commands must run longer than 20 minutes. Or use the [Databricks SQL Driver for Go](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-go) in case your workload type is purely for business intelligence.

```go
res := w.CommandExecutor.Execute(ctx, clusterId, "python", "print(1)")
if res.Failed() {
    return fmt.Errorf("command failed: %w", res.Err())
}
println(res.Text())
// Out: 1
```

### Cluster library management

You can install or uninstall libraries on running Databricks clusters. `UpdateAndWait` follows all conventions of [long-running operations](#long-running-operations) and wraps `Install` and `Uninstall` operations, followed by checking for the installation status of the cluster, exposing error messages back in a simplified way. This high-level wrapper came from the Databricks Terraform provider, where it was tested for over 2 years in the [databricks_cluster](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs/resources/cluster) and [databricks_library](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs/resources/library) resources. Databricks recommends that you use `UpdateAndWait` as the only API for cluster library management.

```go
err = w.Libraries.UpdateAndWait(ctx, libraries.Update{
    ClusterId: clusterId,
    Install: []libraries.Library{
        {
            Pypi: &libraries.PythonPyPiLibrary{
                Package: "dbl-tempo",
            },
        },
    },
})
```

### Advanced usage

You can track the intermediate state of a long-running operation while waiting to reach the correct state by supplying the `func(i *retries.Info[Zzz])` functional option, where `Zzz` is the return type of the `XxxAndWait` method:

```go
clusterInfo, err = w.Clusters.CreateAndWait(ctx, clusters.CreateCluster{
    // ...
}, func(i *retries.Info[clusters.ClusterInfo]) {
    updateIntermediateState(i.Info.StateMessage)
})
```

## Paginated responses

On the platform side, some Databricks APIs have result pagination, and some of them do not. Some APIs follow the offset-plus-limit pagination, some start their offsets from 0 and some from 1, some use the cursor-based iteration, and others just return all results in a single response. The Databricks SDK for Go hides this intricate complexity and generates a more high-level interface for retrieving all results of a certain entity type. The naming pattern is `XxxAll`, where `Xxx` is the name of the method to retrieve a single page of results.

```go
all, err := w.Repos.ListAll(ctx, repos.List{})
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("list repos: %w", err)
}
for _, repo := range all {
    println(repo.Path)
}
```

## `GetByName` utility methods

On the platform side, most of the Databricks APIs could be retrieved primarily by their identifiers. In some common workflows, it's easier to reason about workspace objects by their names. To simplify development experience and speed-up proof-of-concepts, the Databricks SDK for Go generates code for `GetByName` client-side utilities. Please keep in mind, that some Databricks APIs don't enforce unique names on objects and these generated helpers return an error whenever duplicate name is detected.

```go
repo, err := w.Repos.GetByPath(ctx, path)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
return w.Repos.Update(ctx, repos.UpdateRepo{
    RepoId: repo.Id,
    Branch: tag,
})
```

## Node type and Databricks Runtime selectors

The Databricks SDK for Go provides selector methods that make developing multi-cloud applications easier and just rely on characteristics of the virtual machine, such as the number of cores or availability of local disks or always picking up the latest Databricks Runtime for the interactive cluster or per-job cluster.

```go
// Fetch the list of spark runtime versions.
sparkVersions, err := w.Clusters.SparkVersions(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Select the latest LTS version.
latestLTS, err := sparkVersions.Select(clusters.SparkVersionRequest{
    Latest:          true,
    LongTermSupport: true,
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Fetch the list of available node types.
nodeTypes, err := w.Clusters.ListNodeTypes(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Select the smallest node type ID.
smallestWithDisk, err := nodeTypes.Smallest(clusters.NodeTypeRequest{
    LocalDisk: true,
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Create the cluster and wait for it to start properly.
runningCluster, err := w.Clusters.CreateAndWait(ctx, clusters.CreateCluster{
    ClusterName:            clusterName,
    SparkVersion:           latestLTS,
    NodeTypeId:             smallestWithDisk,
    AutoterminationMinutes: 15,
    NumWorkers:             1,
})
```

## Integration with `io` interfaces for DBFS

You can open a file on DBFS for reading or writing with `w.Dbfs.Open`.
This function returns a `dbfs.Handle` that is compatible with a subset of `io`
interfaces for reading, writing, and closing.

Uploading a file from an `io.Reader`:

```go
upload, _ := os.Open("/path/to/local/file.ext")
remote, _ := w.Dbfs.Open(ctx, "/path/to/remote/file", dbfs.FileModeWrite|dbfs.FileModeOverwrite)
_, _ = io.Copy(remote, upload)
_ = remote.Close()
```

Downloading a file to an `io.Writer`:

```go
download, _ := os.Create("/path/to/local")
remote, _ := w.Dbfs.Open(ctx, "/path/to/remote/file", dbfs.FileModeRead)
_, _ = io.Copy(download, remote)
```

### Reading into and writing from buffers

You can read from or write to a DBFS file directly from a byte slice through
the convenience functions `w.Dbfs.ReadFile` and `w.Dbfs.WriteFile`.

Uploading a file from a byte slice:

```go
err := w.Dbfs.WriteFile(ctx, "/path/to/remote/file", []byte("Hello world!"))
```

Downloading a file into a byte slice:

```go
buf, err := w.Dbfs.ReadFile(ctx, "/path/to/remote/file")

## `pflag.Value` for enums

Databricks SDK for Go loosely integrates with [spf13/pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag) by implementing [pflag.Value](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/pflag#Value) for all enum types.

## Logging

By default, Databricks SDK for Go uses [logger.SimpleLogger](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/logger#Logger), which is a levelled proxy to `log.Printf`, printing to `os.Stderr`. You can disable logging completely by adding `log.SetOutput(io.Discard)` to your `init()` function. You are encouraged to override `logging.DefaultLogger` with your own implementation that follows the [logger.Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/logger#Logger) interface.

Since v0.10.0, default logger prints only `INFO` level messages. To replicate more verbose behavior from the previous versions, set the `DEBUG` level in `SimpleLogger`:

```go
import "github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/logger"

func init() {
	logger.DefaultLogger = &logger.SimpleLogger{
		Level: logger.LevelDebug,
	}
}
```

Current Logger interface will evolve in the future versions of Databricks SDK for Go.

## Interface stability

During the [Experimental](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/release-types.html) period, Databricks is actively working on stabilizing the Databricks SDK for Go's interfaces. API clients for all services are generated from specification files that are synchronized from the main platform. You are highly encouraged to pin the exact version in the `go.mod` file and read the [changelog](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) where Databricks documents the changes. Some types of interfaces are more stable than others. For those interfaces that are not yet [nightly tested](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/tree/main/internal), Databricks may have minor [documented](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-go/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) backward-incompatible changes, such as fixing mapping correctness from `int` to `int64` or renaming the methods or some type names to bring more consistency.
