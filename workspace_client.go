	// You can use cluster policies to control users' ability to configure
	// clusters based on a set of rules. These rules specify which attributes or
	// attribute values can be used during cluster creation. Cluster policies
	// have ACLs that limit their use to specific users and groups.
	//
	// With cluster policies, you can: - Auto-install cluster libraries on the
	// next restart by listing them in the policy's "libraries" field (Public
	// Preview). - Limit users to creating clusters with the prescribed
	// settings. - Simplify the user interface, enabling more users to create
	// clusters, by fixing and hiding some fields. - Manage costs by setting
	// limits on attributes that impact the hourly rate.
	//
	// Cluster policy permissions limit which policies a user can select in the
	// Policy drop-down when the user creates a cluster: - A user who has
	// unrestricted cluster create permission can select the Unrestricted policy
	// and create fully-configurable clusters. - A user who has both
	// unrestricted cluster create permission and access to cluster policies can
	// select the Unrestricted policy and policies they have access to. - A user
	// that has access to only cluster policies, can select the policies they

	// Databricks maps cluster node instance types to compute units known as
	// DBUs. See the instance type pricing page for a list of the supported
	// instance types and their corresponding DBUs.
	//
	// A Databricks cluster is a set of computation resources and configurations
	// on which you run data engineering, data science, and data analytics
	// workloads, such as production ETL pipelines, streaming analytics, ad-hoc
	// analytics, and machine learning.
	//
	// You run these workloads as a set of commands in a notebook or as an
	// automated job. Databricks makes a distinction between all-purpose
	// clusters and job clusters. You use all-purpose clusters to analyze data
	// collaboratively using interactive notebooks. You use job clusters to run
	// fast and robust automated jobs.
	//
	// You can create an all-purpose cluster using the UI, CLI, or REST API. You
	// can manually terminate and restart an all-purpose cluster. Multiple users
	// can share such clusters to do collaborative interactive analysis.
	//
	// IMPORTANT: Databricks retains cluster configuration information for
	// terminated clusters for 30 days. To keep an all-purpose cluster
	// configuration even after it has been terminated for more than 30 days, an
	// administrator can pin a cluster to the cluster list.
	Clusters compute.ClustersInterface

	// This API allows execution of Python, Scala, SQL, or R commands on running

	CommandExecution compute.CommandExecutionInterface

	// Connections allow for creating a connection to an external data source.
	//
	// A connection is an abstraction of an external data source that can be
	// connected from Databricks Compute. Creating a connection object is the
	// first step to managing external data sources within Unity Catalog, with
	// the second step being creating a data object (catalog, schema, or table)
	// using the connection. Data objects derived from a connection can be
	// written to or read from similar to other Unity Catalog data objects based
	// on cloud storage. Users may create different types of connections with

	DashboardWidgets sql.DashboardWidgetsInterface

	// In general, there is little need to modify dashboards using the API.
	// However, it can be useful to use dashboard objects to look-up a
	// collection of related query IDs. The API can also be used to duplicate
	// multiple dashboards at once since you can get a dashboard definition with
	// a GET request and then POST it to create a new one. Dashboards can be
	// scheduled using the `sql_task` type of the Jobs API, e.g.
	// :method:jobs/create.
	Dashboards sql.DashboardsInterface

	// This API is provided to assist you in making new query objects. When
	// creating a query object, you may optionally specify a `data_source_id`
	// for the SQL warehouse against which it will run. If you don't already
	// know the `data_source_id` for your desired SQL warehouse, this API will

	//
	// Databricks recommends using external locations rather than using storage
	// credentials directly.
	//
	// To create external locations, you must be a metastore admin or a user
	// with the **CREATE_EXTERNAL_LOCATION** privilege.
	ExternalLocations catalog.ExternalLocationsInterface

	// External Metadata objects enable customers to register and manage

	// An online store is a low-latency database used for feature lookup during
	// real-time model inference or serve feature for real-time applications.
	FeatureStore ml.FeatureStoreInterface

	// The Files API is a standard HTTP API that allows you to read, write,
	// list, and delete files and directories by referring to their URI. The API
	// makes working with file content as raw bytes easier and more efficient.
	//
	// The API supports [Unity Catalog volumes], where files and directories to

	// format
	// /Volumes/&lt;catalog_name&gt;/&lt;schema_name&gt;/&lt;volume_name&gt;/&lt;path_to_file&gt;.
	//
	// The Files API has two distinct endpoints, one for working with files

	// (`/fs/directories`). Both endpoints use the standard HTTP methods GET,
	// HEAD, PUT, and DELETE to manage files and directories specified using
	// their URI path. The path is always absolute.
	//
	// Some Files API client features are currently experimental. To enable
	// them, set `enable_experimental_files_api_client = True` in your

	//
	// **Important:** Existing clusters must be restarted to pick up any changes

	// hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward.
	//
	// Securable objects in Unity Catalog are hierarchical and privileges are

	// and auto-scaling times.
	//
	// Databricks pools reduce cluster start and auto-scaling times by
	// maintaining a set of idle, ready-to-use instances. When a cluster is
	// attached to a pool, cluster nodes are created using the pool’s idle
	// instances. If the pool has no idle instances, the pool expands by
	// allocating a new instance from the instance provider in order to
	// accommodate the cluster’s request. When a cluster releases an instance,
	// it returns to the pool and is free for another cluster to use. Only
	// clusters attached to a pool can use that pool’s idle instances.
	//
	// You can specify a different pool for the driver node and worker nodes, or

	// IP Access List enables admins to configure IP access lists.
	//
	// IP access lists affect web application access and REST API access to this
	// workspace only. If the feature is disabled for a workspace, all access is
	// allowed for this workspace. There is support for allow lists (inclusion)
	// and block lists (exclusion).
	//
	// When a connection is attempted: 1. **First, all block lists are

	//
	// Delta Live Tables is a framework for building reliable, maintainable, and

	// perform on your data, and Delta Live Tables manages task orchestration,
	// cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling.
	//
	// Instead of defining your data pipelines using a series of separate Apache
	// Spark tasks, Delta Live Tables manages how your data is transformed based

	// applications authenticate using short-lived OIDC tokens issued by their
	// own Identity Provider (IdP), such as Azure Entra ID or Okta, without the
	// need for managing static credentials or client secrets. A federation
	// policy defines how non-Databricks recipients authenticate using OIDC
	// tokens. It validates the OIDC claims in federated tokens and is set at
	// the recipient level. The caller must be the owner of the recipient to
	// create or manage a federation policy. Federation policies support the
	// following scenarios: - User-to-Machine (U2M) flow: A user accesses Delta
	// Shares using their own identity, such as connecting through PowerBI Delta
	// Sharing Client. - Machine-to-Machine (M2M) flow: An application accesses
	// Delta Shares using its own identity, typically for automation tasks like
	// nightly jobs through Python Delta Sharing Client. OIDC Token Federation
	// enables fine-grained access control, supports Multi-Factor Authentication
	// (MFA), and enhances security by minimizing the risk of credential leakage
	// through the use of short-lived, expiring tokens. It is designed for

	//
	// - For recipients without access to a Databricks workspace that is enabled
	// for Unity Catalog, when you create a recipient object, Databricks
	// generates an activation link you can send to the recipient. The recipient
	// follows the activation link to download the credential file, and then

	// The Databricks SQL Statement Execution API can be used to execute SQL
	// statements on a SQL warehouse and fetch the result.
	//
	// **Getting started**
	//
	// We suggest beginning with the [Databricks SQL Statement Execution API
	// tutorial].
	//
	// **Overview of statement execution and result fetching**
	//
	// Statement execution begins by issuing a
	// :method:statementexecution/executeStatement request with a valid SQL
	// statement and warehouse ID, along with optional parameters such as the
	// data catalog and output format. If no other parameters are specified, the
	// server will wait for up to 10s before returning a response. If the
	// statement has completed within this timespan, the response will include
	// the result data as a JSON array and metadata. Otherwise, if no result is
	// available after the 10s timeout expired, the response will provide the
	// statement ID that can be used to poll for results by using a
	// :method:statementexecution/getStatement request.
	//
	// You can specify whether the call should behave synchronously,
	// asynchronously or start synchronously with a fallback to asynchronous
	// execution. This is controlled with the `wait_timeout` and
	// `on_wait_timeout` settings. If `wait_timeout` is set between 5-50 seconds
	// (default: 10s), the call waits for results up to the specified timeout;
	// when set to `0s`, the call is asynchronous and responds immediately with
	// a statement ID. The `on_wait_timeout` setting specifies what should
	// happen when the timeout is reached while the statement execution has not
	// yet finished. This can be set to either `CONTINUE`, to fallback to
	// asynchronous mode, or it can be set to `CANCEL`, which cancels the
	// statement.
	//
	// In summary: - Synchronous mode - `wait_timeout=30s` and
	// `on_wait_timeout=CANCEL` - The call waits up to 30 seconds; if the
	// statement execution finishes within this time, the result data is
	// returned directly in the response. If the execution takes longer than 30
	// seconds, the execution is canceled and the call returns with a `CANCELED`
	// state. - Asynchronous mode - `wait_timeout=0s` (`on_wait_timeout` is
	// ignored) - The call doesn't wait for the statement to finish but returns
	// directly with a statement ID. The status of the statement execution can
	// be polled by issuing :method:statementexecution/getStatement with the
	// statement ID. Once the execution has succeeded, this call also returns
	// the result and metadata in the response. - Hybrid mode (default) -
	// `wait_timeout=10s` and `on_wait_timeout=CONTINUE` - The call waits for up
	// to 10 seconds; if the statement execution finishes within this time, the
	// result data is returned directly in the response. If the execution takes
	// longer than 10 seconds, a statement ID is returned. The statement ID can
	// be used to fetch status and results in the same way as in the
	// asynchronous mode.
	//
	// Depending on the size, the result can be split into multiple chunks. If
	// the statement execution is successful, the statement response contains a
	// manifest and the first chunk of the result. The manifest contains schema
	// information and provides metadata for each chunk in the result. Result
	// chunks can be retrieved by index with
	// :method:statementexecution/getStatementResultChunkN which may be called
	// in any order and in parallel. For sequential fetching, each chunk, apart
	// from the last, also contains a `next_chunk_index` and
	// `next_chunk_internal_link` that point to the next chunk.
	//
	// A statement can be canceled with
	// :method:statementexecution/cancelExecution.
	//
	// **Fetching result data: format and disposition**
	//
	// To specify the format of the result data, use the `format` field, which
	// can be set to one of the following options: `JSON_ARRAY` (JSON),
	// `ARROW_STREAM` ([Apache Arrow Columnar]), or `CSV`.
	//
	// There are two ways to receive statement results, controlled by the
	// `disposition` setting, which can be either `INLINE` or `EXTERNAL_LINKS`:
	//
	// - `INLINE`: In this mode, the result data is directly included in the
	// response. It's best suited for smaller results. This mode can only be
	// used with the `JSON_ARRAY` format.
	//
	// - `EXTERNAL_LINKS`: In this mode, the response provides links that can be
	// used to download the result data in chunks separately. This approach is
	// ideal for larger results and offers higher throughput. This mode can be
	// used with all the formats: `JSON_ARRAY`, `ARROW_STREAM`, and `CSV`.
	//
	// By default, the API uses `format=JSON_ARRAY` and `disposition=INLINE`.
	//
	// **Limits and limitations**
	//
	// Note: The byte limit for INLINE disposition is based on internal storage
	// metrics and will not exactly match the byte count of the actual payload.
	//
	// - Statements with `disposition=INLINE` are limited to 25 MiB and will
	// fail when this limit is exceeded. - Statements with
	// `disposition=EXTERNAL_LINKS` are limited to 100 GiB. Result sets larger
	// than this limit will be truncated. Truncation is indicated by the
	// `truncated` field in the result manifest. - The maximum query text size
	// is 16 MiB. - Cancelation might silently fail. A successful response from
	// a cancel request indicates that the cancel request was successfully
	// received and sent to the processing engine. However, an outstanding
	// statement might have already completed execution when the cancel request
	// arrives. Polling for status until a terminal state is reached is a
	// reliable way to determine the final state. - Wait timeouts are
	// approximate, occur server-side, and cannot account for things such as
	// caller delays and network latency from caller to service. - To guarantee
	// that the statement is kept alive, you must poll at least once every 15
	// minutes. - The results are only available for one hour after success;
	// polling does not extend this. - The SQL Execution API must be used for
	// the entire lifecycle of the statement. For example, you cannot use the
	// Jobs API to execute the command, and then the SQL Execution API to cancel
	// it.

	// SCIM streamlines onboarding a new employee or team by using your identity
	// provider to create users and groups in Databricks workspace and give them
	// the proper level of access. When a user leaves your organization or no
	// longer needs access to Databricks workspace, admins can terminate the
	// user in your identity provider and that user’s account will also be
	// removed from Databricks workspace. This ensures a consistent offboarding
	// process and prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data.

	// **Endpoint**: Represents the compute resources to host vector search
	// indexes.
	VectorSearchEndpoints vectorsearch.VectorSearchEndpointsInterface

	// **Index**: An efficient representation of your embedding vectors that
	// supports real-time and efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)
	// search queries.
	//
	// There are 2 types of Vector Search indexes: - **Delta Sync Index**: An
	// index that automatically syncs with a source Delta Table, automatically
	// and incrementally updating the index as the underlying data in the Delta
	// Table changes. - **Direct Vector Access Index**: An index that supports
	// direct read and write of vectors and metadata through our REST and SDK
	// APIs. With this model, the user manages index updates.

	// Volumes are a Unity Catalog (UC) capability for accessing, storing,
	// governing, organizing and processing files. Use cases include running
	// machine learning on unstructured data such as image, audio, video, or PDF
	// files, organizing data sets during the data exploration stages in data
	// science, working with libraries that require access to the local file
	// system on cluster machines, storing library and config files of arbitrary
	// formats such as .whl or .txt centrally and providing secure access across
	// workspaces to it, or transforming and querying non-tabular data files in
	// ETL.

	// A securable in Databricks can be configured as __OPEN__ or __ISOLATED__.
	// An __OPEN__ securable can be accessed from any workspace, while an
	// __ISOLATED__ securable can only be accessed from a configured list of
	// workspaces. This API allows you to configure (bind) securables to
	// workspaces.
	//
	// NOTE: The __isolation_mode__ is configured for the securable itself
	// (using its Update method) and the workspace bindings are only consulted
	// when the securable's __isolation_mode__ is set to __ISOLATED__.
	//
	// A securable's workspace bindings can be configured by a metastore admin
	// or the owner of the securable.
	//
	// The original path
	// (/api/2.1/unity-catalog/workspace-bindings/catalogs/{name}) is
	// deprecated. Please use the new path
	// (/api/2.1/unity-catalog/bindings/{securable_type}/{securable_name}) which
	// introduces the ability to bind a securable in READ_ONLY mode (catalogs
	// only).
	//
	// Securable types that support binding: - catalog - storage_credential -
	// credential - external_location
